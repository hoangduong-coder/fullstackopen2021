# Exercise 1

Some common steps in CI can be handled by different tools, for example in JavaScript and TypeScript, we often use JSLint, ESLint, JSHint for lint, npm build for building, and Jest, Cypress, and Mocha are the most popular options for unit and functional testing.
Nowadays, we can use Buddy, Integrity, and TeamCity for building CI setups. Moreover, some developers prefer using GitLab CI instead of GitHub, since GitLab provides a more centralized and integrated platform, and GitLab is somehow more suitable for private code used to build CI systems.
Thanks to the development of technology, people prefer more secure, convenient, and modern methods for solving different problems in their working life. For instance, in Software Development, developers' working time has decreased since there are some smarter ways for managing and maintaining the project, including cloud-based and self-hosted. However, cloud services became a better option for CI setup. The cloud-based environment uses nix-based systems such as Unix, and Linux, which has been proven as safe protection against virus attack. It is also more economical since with a self-hosted environment, we have to enable more internal networks. Moreover, cloud service is more accessible and eco-friendly than traditional methods, since everything people need is a stable internet connection. As a result, the heat released from the hardware can increase the greenhouse effect.
